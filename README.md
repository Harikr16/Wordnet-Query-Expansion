# Wordnet-Query-Expansion

Information Retrieval Project.

I have expanded TREC queries by Wordnet by adding synonyms for every token  after removing stop words, and lemmatizing.
I have used used Lucene Search engine to compare the search results with baseline results.

I have used Python NLTK to use Wordnet database to expand the query.
